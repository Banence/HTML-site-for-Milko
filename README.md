# Number systems converter and calculator
Our site is just about helping young students who are interested in learning different number systems to do so. We have a binary calculator which can add, subtract, devide and multiplicate two binary numbers with up to 99%
accuracy. We also have a converter which has different choices like a decimal to binary, binary to decimal, dicimal to hexadecimal, hexadecimal to decimal etc. We used very basic level of JavaScript and tried to make the 
website to be used as easy as possible. Our goal was to also add an explaination how to convert the numbers with tutorials but due to limitation in time we can provide only the final answer of what the customer wants.
In the future there will definately be a video tutorials and explaination in the site so stay tuned for more updates.
